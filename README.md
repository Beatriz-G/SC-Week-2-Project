<h2>About</h2>

Repo for SheCodes week two project. After dowloading the starter code, I had to add JavaScript to 
create a prompt asking the user what city they are in and what the current temperature is. 
<br>Once submitted, the screen changes the h1 heading to show the city and the temperture. 
<br> If the temperature is more than 0 degrees, the sun emoji changes to a smiley face. If it 
is less than or equal to 0 degrees, a sad smiley face will replace the sun.
